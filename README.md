# PHPSockets With WebSockets

Here we will see how to create a websocket server working with a php sockets.

The file is meant to be understood in a simple and effective way.

<h3>How to setup?</h3>

Testing in your local apache all ports are avaiable (I hope so).

To configure host in WebSockets open aplicacao.js and find the <code>var host = 'ws://localhost:8080';</code> in my case is listening in localhost in port 8080.

To configure host in PHP Sockets open server.php and find the <code>$adr = "localhost"; $port = 8080;</code> in my case is running in localhost in port 8080.

(The port and address need to be the same - If the websockets is in port 6570, php sockets need to be in port 6570)


<h3>How to Test It?</h3>

<ul>1. I'm using WampServer (Version: 2.4.9, PHP: 5.5.12)</ul>
<ul>2. You need to download the files from my github and put inside your apache, in my case, inside www folder. (C://wamp/www/Sockets)</ul>
<ul>3. Great now you have to open in your browser the index.php file, when you do this you'll receive this message in red: "Disconectado do WebSocket.", this is because you don´t setup the server yet.</ul>
<ul>4. To setup the server open the file server.php in your browser, and you´ll see that page in a infinite loop (loading....loading....loading in browser), cool! The socket is running!</ul>
<ul>5. Now go to index.php file and if you receive a message in color green, you are connected with the server :D</ul>
